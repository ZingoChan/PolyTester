# PolyTester
An entire thing about how I made PolyTester. Just one HTML file

# 1. What's PolyTester?
PolyTester is a random project made by me (ZingoChan) to test how strong the GPU is based on how many polygons you see in the cube. You can do stuff like changing the cube's or background's color, setting the UI theme. And most importantly, set the amount of polys that are in the cube. 

# 2. Why?
Idk, it was supposed to be a project that teaches me how to web develop. At first, it was a 3D Car driving game, but I scrapped out then did smth easier for my ability. Then here it is, PolyTester, not only simple but very cool and helpful. As a Roblox Game Dev, I always make detailed stuff,f but never knew my PC was burning. After buying a new set, I decided to make this after having courses in Web Development to see if I could make some:L.

# 3. Conclusion
Bruh, just have fun if u wanted to lol.
