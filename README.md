# PolyTester

An entire thing about how I made **PolyTester**. Just one HTML file.

## 1. What's PolyTester?

**PolyTester** is a random project made by me (**ZingoChan**) to test how strong the GPU is based on how many polygons you see in the cube.

You can do stuff like:
- Changing the cube’s or background’s color
- Setting the UI theme
- Most importantly, changing the amount of polygons in the cube

## 2. Why?

Idk, it was supposed to be a project that teaches me how to web develop.

At first, it was a 3D car driving game, but I scrapped that and did something easier for my ability.  
Then here it is — **PolyTester**, not only simple but very cool and helpful.

As a Roblox Game Dev, I always make detailed stuff, but I never knew my PC was burning.  
After buying a new setup, I decided to make this after taking some Web Dev courses — to see if I could make something. :L
